The package will consist of six classes:
1)PongGame    2) GameFrame    3) GamePanel    4) Paddle   5) Ball   6) Score


This project is highly Object-oriented programming (OOP) material and includes graphics, getters & setters, jpanel & jframe, inheritance & composition.

About the game
The ball moves in the rectangle of play and a goal is scored if the ball reaches one of the right or left sides, and it is calculated using a counting system.

I'm a fan of table tennis or Ping Pong. This game was one of the first games that were programmed, as it was released by Atari in 1972, which was one of the most famous games at the time, and it took its name Pong from Ping Pong.


-	The problem
Because of the recent epidemic conditions, it was difficult to go out to play Ping Pong in the playgrounds, so programming a model of it today is fun.
